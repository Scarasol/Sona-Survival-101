This mod adds a range of survival elements and effects to the game, designed to increase the difficulty of the game.

It is a dependency to the Zombie Survival Kit version 2.0.0 and above, but can also be used on its own.

The main features added by the mod are the six systems of Infection, Injury, Decay, Rust, Sound Following and Locked. The specifics of each system can be configured specifically in the configuration file.

Besides, a series of potion effects have been added to the module, some of which can be combined to create new effects.

You can add it to the mod pack.
